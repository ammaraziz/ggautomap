ggautomap makes it easy to visualise your data on a map when you have a
column in the data that names a place/region. Other packages can
register map data, such as `nswgeo`.

## Installation

You can install ggautomap like so:

``` r
options(repos = c(
  cidmph = 'https://cidm-ph.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
  
install.packages('ggautomap')
```

## Registering map data

ggautomap provides the tools for visualising maps, but you need to get
the map data itself from somewhere. You can either register it with
`register_map()`, or use one of these packages that register their own
map data:

- `{nswgeo}` - map data of New South Wales, Australia. Also includes
  more detailed examples of using ggautomap.

## Example

ggautomap comes with one example dataset registered. You can register
additional map datasets or depend on another package that registers them
for you.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggautomap)

feature_types()
#> [1] "sf.nc"
head(feature_names("sf.nc"))
#> [1] "Ashe"        "Alleghany"   "Surry"       "Currituck"   "Northampton"
#> [6] "Hertford"
```

All you need is a column in your dataset that matches the
`feature_names()` of the map data. For the `"sf.nc"` map data, this
dataset is suitable:

``` r
head(nc_type_example)
#>   location type
#> 1   Bertie    A
#> 2   Bertie    A
#> 3   Bertie    B
#> 4  Pamlico    B
#> 5   Warren    B
#> 6  Pamlico    B
```

You can then use this data with the geoms to provide map summaries. For
the map outline, youâ€™ll need to specify `feature_type`, but the other
geoms will usually be able to guess the correct value.

``` r
ggplot(nc_type_example, aes(location = location)) +
  geom_boundaries(feature_type = "sf.nc") +
  geom_geoscatter(aes(colour = type), size = 0.5)
```

  geom_boundaries(feature_type = "sf.nc") +
  geom_centroids(aes(colour = type, scale = 6), size = 0.5)

  geom_choropleth() +
  scale_fill_steps(low = "#e6f9ff", high = "#00394d", na.value = "white")
